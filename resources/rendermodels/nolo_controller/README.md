# SteamVR Rendermodel for NOLO Controller

This rendermodel for the NOLO controllers was derived from the models made available by Nolo [here](https://github.com/NOLOVR/NOLO-Others/tree/master/NOLO_Controller_Model). I took the obj file and used [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to scale things to match SteamVR, and then I broke out the mesh components that I needed into separate obj files. The *vr_controller_vive_1_5* model in SteamVR was used an as example of how to dsecribe the functionality in the JSON file.
